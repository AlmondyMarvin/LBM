### Future plans to improve the code
* Set up different initial perturbations.
* Reduce memory usage by storing pre-collision and post-collision distribution function in a single variable (F).
* Try different obstacles including streamlined shapes (i.e. airfoils).
* Calculate C<sub>D</sub> & C<sub>L</sub> and compare it to literature value.
* Try spinning obstacle.
* Simulate other variables such as heat.
