# LBM
A Lattice Boltzmann based code to simulate simple fluid flow problems.

Lattice Boltzman is a method that simulates particle movement in a microscopic scale that can

### Advantages of LBM

### Disadvantages of LBM
*Not suitable for high Reynolds Number.

### Future plans to improve the code
* Set up different initial perturbations.
* Reduce memory usage by storing pre-collision and post-collision distribution function in a single variable (F).
* Try different obstacles including streamlined shapes (i.e. airfoils).
* Calculate C<sub>D</sub> & C<sub>L</sub> and compare it to literature value.
* Try spinning obstacle.
* Simulate other variables such as heat.
