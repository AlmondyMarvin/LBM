# LBM
A Lattice Boltzmann based code to simulate simple 2-D fluid flow over an obstacle.


## Introduction
Lattice Boltzman is a  method that is based on kinetic theory

#### Advantages of LBM
*Algorithm is relatively simple.
*Relatively simpler to paralellize when compared to traditional CFD.
*Suitable for multi-phase flow.

#### Disadvantages of LBM
*Not suitable for high Reynolds Numbers and consequently not good for compressible flow.

### Future plans to improve the code
* Set up different initial perturbations.
* Reduce memory usage by storing pre-collision and post-collision distribution function in a single variable (F).
* Try different obstacles including streamlined shapes (i.e. airfoils).
* Calculate C<sub>D</sub> & C<sub>L</sub> and compare it to literature value.
* Try having a spinning obstacle.
* Simulate other field variables such as heat.
