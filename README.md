# LBM
A Lattice Boltzmann based code to simulate simple 2-D fluid flow over an obstacle.

## Introduction
Lattice Boltzman is a  method that is based on kinetic theory that instead of simulating a continuum flow like in traditional CFD it simulates molecules in a "latice" where particles collide and stream [1], as shown in Figure 1. This code was based on the D2Q9 structure with direction and velocities as shown in Figure 2.

<sub>More information about LBM will be added once more literature review is done.</sub>

#### Advantages of LBM [4]
* Algorithm is relatively simple.
* Relatively simpler to paralellize when compared to traditional CFD.
* Suitable for multi-phase flow.
* Mesh-free

#### Disadvantages of LBM [4]
* Not suitable for high Reynolds Numbers and consequently not good for compressible flow, particles can only move 1 lattice step per unit time. 
* Cannot handle low viscosities.
* Unproven for high Knudsen numbers.

### Future plans to improve the code
* Set up different initial perturbations.
* Reduce memory usage by storing pre-collision and post-collision distribution function in a single variable (F).
* Try different obstacles including streamlined shapes (i.e. airfoils).
* Calculate C<sub>D</sub> & C<sub>L</sub> and compare it to literature value.
* Try having a spinning obstacle.
* Simulate other field variables such as heat.
